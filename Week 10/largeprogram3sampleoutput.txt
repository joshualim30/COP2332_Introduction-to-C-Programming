Welcome to the Hangman Game!
************************************************************************
Here are the rules.
I will provide you a set of * characters for each round.
Each * represents a letter in the English Alphabet.
You must figure out each letter of the missing word.
For every correct letter guessed, I will reveal its place in the word.
Each mistake will result in a strike.
6 strikes will result in a loss that round.
Are you ready? Here we go!
