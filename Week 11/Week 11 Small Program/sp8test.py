#Dr. Andrew Steinberg
#COP3223C Student Python Script v1.1
#This script will automatically compile, run, and compare your results to a provided txt file that contains sample output.
#DO NOT MODIFY THE CONTENTS OF THIS FILE!
#You do not need understand this code as this is out of the scope of this course. However, if you are interested you can discuss with Dr. Steinberg
#New to v1.1 update, leading and trailing whitespace is automatically eliminated.
