# COP2332_Intoduction to C Programming

## Class Information
**Instructor:** Dr. Steinberg

**University:** University of Central Florida

**Semester Taken:** Fall 2022
 
## Folder Organization:
Folders are separated into weeks in descending order from the beginning of the semester to the end, updated as projects are assigned and completed. Inside weekly folders may contain Large Program and Small Program folders, in which these subfolders were assignments assigned the same week but have different goals. My (Joshua Lim) work is always labeled "smallprogram#/largeprogram#_MyLastName_MyFirstname.c"_ per instructor request. 
_(Example: smallprogram0_Lim.Joshua.c)_
All other files were what I used to guide my assignment towards the instructors curriculum as well as check if the program outputs the correct information upon testing using the python script provided by the instructor. These C files have been tested both on a local Mac machine and a remote Eustis machine per instructor request.
